Johannes Rehnstr√∂m's Home Page
==============================

Hi there. I'm Johannes, a self-taught aspiring programmer and software developer. On this site you will find my programming projects. For now the only project is [Taylor Bundles](1). Upcoming projects are an interactive visualization of the nutrient density of foods, and an interactive/animated rendition of _Euclid's Elements._

There's also [my blog](2), focused on math. It's mostly fun applications of high school level math, nothing too advanced.
